## Requirements

Please install the following, if you do not already have them installed:

- Node.js >v20.10.0

## Preparing the backend

Before running the frontend, please make sure to prepare and start the backend by following the instructions in the [`backend/README.md`](backend/README.md) file.

git init
npm install
```

## Start

To start the app in development mode, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```
